This is a mini project for me to design an algorithm that can visually diagnose melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. The algorithm will attempt to distinguish this malignant skin tumor from two types of benign lesions (nevi and seborrheic keratoses).

__Please note__ this has not started so there is no code here yet!
